# 100 Days CSS Challenge

Time will tell how long I last.

## Day 1 An Animated Hover

An overlay that moves up and down like a blind based on hover. Interactive so
used JS. Couldn't figure out how to add a vertical blur to the text so added a
gradient.

## Day 2 An Animated Gradient Background

The background is a moving, changing, gradient. Created initial code using a
gradient tool and then played around with the positioning.
