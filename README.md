# 100 Days CSS Challenges

The [100 Days CSS Challenges](https://100dayscss.com/) are numbered, I started
in the middle, but will re-cycle back to day one to cover them all.

## 001: Animated Hamburger Menu Icon

The standard _I Ching_ heaven tri-gram used to represent a hidden menu on small
screens transforms into an X when it has focus.

## 059: Hover - Blind Effect

An overlay that moves up and down like a blind based on hover. Interactive so
used JS. Couldn't figure out how to add a vertical blur to the text so added a
gradient.

## 060: An Animated Gradient Background

The background is a moving, changing, gradient. Created initial code using a
gradient tool and then played around with the positioning.

## 063: Hover - Offset Effect

Two divisions swap place on hover using transition effect. Trick to getting a
smooth effect was

1. setting the `will-change` property
1. applying the transition to the `center` class only
